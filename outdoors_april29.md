## Adaptive surfing offers an ocean of possibilities ##

While driving home from a school football game in October 2017, multisport-athlete Isaac Coulapides was in a single-car accident that severed his spine, fractured his sternum and left hm paralyzed from the chest down.

As the reality of his condition set in, Coulapides said his greatest fear was losing his independence as well as the ability to continue doing all of the sports he loved.

"I always knew that somehow I'd sur agin. I just didn't know how," he said, before doning a wetsuit for a surfing session. "I'm excited to be back in the water and I'm having a blast."

## Surf camp ##

Over the past three years, Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) has hosted five Junior Seau adaptive surf camps each year. Most of the camps are staffed with CAF staff, lifeguards and rescue-trained volunteers, who accompany the youths in and out of the water.

All of the youths are attending the camp on grants, and many have received athleteic equipment and travel grants in the past from CAF.

## Being an inspiration ##

For most of his life, Christiaan "Otter" Bailey has been a professional skateboarder and surfer. While filmig tricks for a skate video in 2006, he damaged his spine and was paralyzed from the waist down. It wasn't long before he was competing again as a wheelchair skater and adaptive surfer.

Now aptain of USA Surfing, Bailey said he's thrilled to see how adaptive sports, particularly surfing, are being taught and celebrated in countries around the world. At many events like this adaptive surf camp, he volunteers as a mentor to young athletes.

"World titles and national titles are great but they're superficial compared to the impact I can make on the next generation," he said. "That's my real legacy."

Bailey teamed up with Coulapides to serve as his camp mentor.

"They're role models for me," Coupapides said. "If they can do it, I know I can set a goal and I can get there too."


'More conidence, self-esteeem and a sense of independence'

Among the other campers is Ella Rodriguez, who had her right leg amputated below the knee when she was nine months old. She started surging at age 7 and has competed in wheelchair basketball, cheerleading and track and field. She dreams of being a Paralympian and having a career in the medical field.

Rodriguez said adaptive sports have given her more confidence, self-esteem and a sense of independence. She hopes to serve as an example for some of the first-teim surf campers.

"I think the best advice I can offer them is to not be afraid to ask for help and to just have fun," she said.
