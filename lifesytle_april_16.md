## Three little words that can help you connect with everyone ##

One rainy afternoon, I was on a crosstown bus when a young woman jumped on. She had a child with her who must have been about 3 or 4 years old.

The bus was full, bumpoy, and it soon got noisy as her kid began crying; he was upset he couldn't sit next to his mother. There were a couple of open seats, but they weren't together. She was flustered and looked embarrassed.

Then another woman, a little older, stood up and moved so that the mother and child could sit together. The mom smiled as a thank-you. And then three words came out of the older woman's mouth that elevated the entire energy of that bus ride: "I've been there."


## Connecting through shared experiences ##

Simple, undramatic and honest. In that moment, it seemed to unite people. Why? BEcause almost all experiences are shared human experiences. We forget that, as we forge through life, focused on our won troubles and needs--which are actually less unique than we think. How can these three words create more connection in your life?

ASk:"Where am I holding back?"

## Offering a helping had ##

One thing I know for sure is this: Healing others helps heal yourself. I noticed this recently with my friend, Tracy, who took a new friend who had suffered a miscarriage under her wing. Tracy had three of them before having her daughter tow years ago. Our intellect needs a doctor to explain the medical side of things, yes. But our souls need human connection to help us along. NO one dcan do that better than someone who has been exactly where you are.

Can the essence ofthese three words help you make a small difference right now? It can be as simple as volunteering your seat, sharing some helpful advice or even lightening the mood with a joke when you notice that someone's uncomfortable--because we're all in this together.
