## Fear: A destroyer of teamwork ##

What if I said that success in the knowledge economy is predicated on having a corporate climate that does not ridicule, silence or intimidate the steady flow of new ideas, questions from left field, experimentation or out loud brainstoriming, but allows for such things to be a key part of the creative process? Does such a work environment sound too good to be true? Not if people-centered leaders can create the conditions necessary for these outcomes to happen. And this premise can be described in two crucial words: psychological safety.

In research conducted for her book, The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning Innovation, and Growth, Amy C. Edmondson, a professor at the Harvard Business School, finds that psychological safety is the antidote to toxic, fear-based management structures still so prevalent today.

## Psychological safety defined ##

Edmondson succinctly describes psychological safety in a recent podcast: Psychological safety is a brief that I can bring my full self to work. It's a sense that my voice will be welcomeed ... if I speak up with work-relevant issues, questions, concerns and even mistakes.

The reason this is so important today, says Edmondson, is because we live in a world in which knowledge, insight and expertise are the currency and the source of value creation in industries ranging from healthcare to retail to technology.

"If I have knowledge but I can't use that knowledge or express that Knowledge becaue I'm holding back fro some reason, then value is lost," say Edmondson.

Not only taht, but people who do speak out in ways that threaten hierarchy and authority are typically fired. Edmondson says fear is costly as talent, knowledge and expertise are lost.

Another Harvard Business School professor, James L. Heskett, wrote up a great advance summary of the book, stating that "fear inhibits learning and cooperation" and fosters an "epidemic of silence." Psychological safety, on the other hand, leads to "greater learning, performace and even lower morality (in a healthcare setting)."
