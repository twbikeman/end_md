## Fear: A destroyer of teamwork ##

What if I said that success in the knowledge economy is predicated on having a corporate climate that does not ridicule, silence or intimidate the steady flow of new ideas, questions from left field, experimentation or out loud brainstoriming, but allows for such things to be a key part of the creative process? Does such a work environment sound too good to be true? Not if people-centered leaders can create the conditions necessary for these outcomes to happen. And this premise can be described in two crucial words: psychological safety.

In research conducted for her book, The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning Innovation, and Growth, Amy C. Edmondson, a professor at the Harvard Business School, finds that psychological safety is the antidote to toxic, fear-based management structures still so prevalent today.

## Psychological safety defined ##

Edmondson succinctly describes psychological safety in a recent podcast: Psychological safety is a brief that I can bring my full self to work. It's a sense that my voice will be welcomeed ... if I speak up with work-relevant issues, questions, concerns and even mistakes.

The reason this is so important today, says Edmondson, is because we live in a world in which knowledge, insight and expertise are the currency and the source of value creation in industries ranging from healthcare to retail to technology.

"If I have knowledge but I can't use that knowledge or express that Knowledge becaue I'm holding back fro some reason, then value is lost," say Edmondson.

Not only taht, but people who do speak out in ways that threaten hierarchy and authority are typically fired. Edmondson says fear is costly as talent, knowledge and expertise are lost.

Another Harvard Business School professor, James L. Heskett, wrote up a great advance summary of the book, stating that "fear inhibits learning and cooperation" and fosters an "epidemic of silence." Psychological safety, on the other hand, leads to "greater learning, performace and even lower morality (in a healthcare setting)."

## Shape yourself into a master salesperson ##
EVen if you've never so much as sold candy door-to-door for a school fundraiser, you have sales experience. You sell an idea when you persuade someone to your point of view or an image when you meet someone for the first time. So, even if you don't meet someone for the first time. So, even if you don't plan on becoming a professional salesperson, you adapt some of the traits of a master salesperson.

"I've met a tremendous amount of talented, successful people. They've taught me a great deal," said the late Paul J. Meyer, authour of *Pink Slip Proof: How to Control All Future Paychecks*.

## In his book, Meyer listed five basic qualities shared by every master salesperson: ##

1. All master salespeople are persuasive and convincing. The ability to persuade isn't limited to leaders-any time you help someone see something your way, you have made a sale. Top salespeople use every technique at their disposal, including stories, dreams and humor.

2. All master salespeople focus on service. Meyer cited the "golden rule" of service--serve others as you would like to be served. A salesperson who goes out of their way of focus on service will likely win their customers' loyalty.

3. All master salespeople are honest. If you're a known liar, no one's going to trust you enough to buy what you're selling.

"Top salespeople are honest, keep their word, work hard, are responsible, incredibly dependable and act with complete integrity in all they do," said Meyer.

4. All master salespeople are self-motivating. Master salespeople motivate themselves to accomplish goals, no matter how they feel or what other people say.


"Self-motivation requires the development of inner strength, conscious willpower, overwhelming desier and the determination to reach any goal you personally want to achieve, said Meyer.

5. All master salespeople care about other people. The best salespeople genuinely want to leave their clients better off than they found them. They're not selling to make money but to give their clients a needed product or service.
