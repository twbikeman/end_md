# Keeping your feelings in check #

## Seven strategies emotionally intelligent people use to maage their emotions ##

Our emotions influence practically every decision we make.

Instead of leading a robotic existence, our feelings and emotions motivate and inspire us. The probelm is when we become victims of emotion.

In my new book, EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence, I compare your ability to direct your thoughts to a set of controls on a media player. Just like these controls can help you get the most out of movie or song, these methods help manage your emotional reactions.

1. Pause
Take time to stop and think before you speak or act. Doing so can prevent you from doing something you'll reget--like sending an angry email or posting something regerttable on social media. 

How to use it: If you feel your emotions getting out of control, pause. If possible, go for a short walk. Once you've calmed down, decide how you want ot move forward.

2. Volume control
Have you ever noticed that when speaking with someone, the other person usually responds in the exact same style or tone? If you're calm and rational, they'll respond in kind. Yell or scream, and they'll do the same.

How to use it: If a discussion begins to escalate, dial it back by softening your tone or lowering your voice.

3. Mute 

If an interaction turns emotional, and leaving the situation is not an option, you might need to put yourself on "mute." In other words, stop speaking.

Hitting mute is helpful because often sharing your point of view when your partner is emtional won't help the situation.

How to use it: Take a deep breath and remind yourself that both your mood and that of your partner are temporary. Remember, much of what they say at this point may be extreme or exaggerated; resist the urge to respond in kind. In many cases, once the person has let everything out, they'll calm down.


4. Record

Reocrding is concentrated listening, with the intent to learn more about another person's perspective. You're tyring to figure out how to perspective. You're not trying to figure out how to reply; instead, you're listening to understand.

Through attentive listening, you often see things you didn't see before and can even discover basic misunderstandings you didn't know existed.

**How to use it** : Don't judge or offer advice. Instead, focus on learning more about how the other person sees you, how they see themselves and how they see the situation.

5. Rewind

Emotionally-cahrged discussions are often rooted in deep-seated issues. If let alone, these problems will continue springing up.

That's why you can't just try and forget about the situation. Instead, use rewind to revisit the topic at later time, once everyone's had the chance to cool down.

**How to use it** : Carefully think about where, when and how to reintroduce the subject.

Opening with an apology, thanks or by acknowledging where you agree may lead the other person to lowerguard and become more open.

6. Fast-forward

Fast-forwarding to the end may ruin a film, but it's extremely helpful when dealing with your emotions. After you pause, step back and think about the consequences of your actions may lead the other person to lower their guard and become more open.

**How to use it** : Forget about how you feel in the moment. How will this affect you in a month? A year?

7. Slow motion

Slowing down to analyze your negative emotions can help you figure out the underlying reasons behind your feeling and potential solutions.

**How to use it**: The next time you're dealing with negative feelings or a bad mood, slow down and ask yourself why you feel the way you do. Can you cange a situation that will make things better? Or, can you ask someone for help?

Emotional health

We are emotional creatures.

The key is not to take emotions out of the equation, but rather, to find balance. It's about learning to harmonize rational thought with deep emotions, balancing "brain" with "heart."
