## Tips for resume ##

Q: Despite sending out dozens of resumes, I have never been called for an iterview. Since I have 12 years of professional experience and excellent educational qualifications, I don't know what the problem is. I even paid an expert to prepare my resume, but that hasn't helped. Do you have any suggestions?

A: A resume is a sales tool with a single purpose: to convince an empolyer to talk with you instead of someone else. So even though you had professional assitance, the absense of interviews mya indicate some deficiencies. Consider the following questions:

## Do you customize your resume for every opening? ##

A generic resume might fail to convince employers that you're special enough to interview. To make a stronger impression, highlight the most relevant aspects of your experience for each postion. A careful review of the job description may suggest key words to include.

## Does the resume include everything in your background which might favorably impress an interviewer? ##

Training, certifications, special assignments, leadership roles--even volunteer work--can all help you get noticed.

## Have you double-checked for mistakes and misspellings? ##

A single slip-up can make you appear careless and cause employers to worry about the qaulity of your work.

When sending your resume electronically, do you know how it may look on the receiving end? One applicant learned too late that her fancy bullets had turned into tiny little lips! Stick with standard fonts and formats, and then email some friends as a test.

## Have you gotten feedback from knowledgeable acquaintances? ##

If you know folks who work in management or human resources ask them to review your resume from an employer's perspective.

## Take time to network with people in your field ##

Connect with contacts from the past 12 years and make new ones through professional associations or interest groups. Interviewers often give first  priority to applicant referred by someone they know.
