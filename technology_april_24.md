## Roy Orbison hologram concert in L.A. invites awe and debate ##

In the darkened Wiltern Theatre, hundreds of people couldn't wait to see legendary rocker Roy Orbison. A live orchestra pumped up the crowd with a medley o f his hits. Old photos of him flashed across a giant screen.

Then, the crooner appeared to rise magically from the stage, wearing his signature light gray suit, balck shades and jamming on a red Gibon guitar to his 1960 hit "Only the Lonely." Fans screamed as they quickly positioned their smartphones to record the spectral image.

"This is as good as seeing him in peson as you'll ever get," marveled 71-year-old Ray Sadowski, who paid about $200 fro a pair of tickets to the October 2nd night show.

## Back in the spotlight ##
 Thirty years after his death, Orbison (at least the digital version of him) is going on a national tour, the latest and possibly the most ambitious example to date of how holographic technology is transforming the music industry.

 The hologram's 65-minute show, which features 16 songs and orchestral accompaniment, is among the first full-length concerts to feature a holographic dead singer.

 Such images and shows are becoming more common, as families of deceased celebrities look for new ways to prolong and capitalize on their legacies. That has prompted some celebritites to add lanuage in their contracts about holograms and to be more meticulous about selecting who is charge of their estates.

 Th growth in technology has spawned a cottage industry of companies specializing in creating these effects. It has also created new revenue opportunities for music label looking to boost record sales.

 Jeffrey Pezzuti, Los Angeles-based Eyellusion's chief executive, says music companies have a back catalog they need to continue to sell, and if artists "are not in front of people, it's hard to get a lot of buzz." Holographic images can solve that issue for deceased legacy artists.

 "It's whole industry change," he said. "We can keep the legacies going and keep them on the road."

 ## Fake videos are becoming more realistic ##

 All it takes is a single selfie.

From that static image, an algorithm can quickly create a moving, lifelike avatar: a video not recorded, but fabricated from wole cloth by software.

With more time, Pinscreen, the Loa Aneles startup behind the technology, believes its renderings will become so accurate they will defy reality.

"You won't be able to tell," sai Hao Li, a leading researcher on computer-generated video at the University of Southern California who founded Pinscreen in 2015. "With further deep learning advancements, espcially on mobile devices, we'll be able to produce completely photo-real avatars in real time."

Not available for a video chat? Use your life-like avatar as a stand-in. Want to insert yourself into a virtual reality game? Upload your picutre and have the game render your character.

Those are the benign applications.

## Playing with fire ##

It's not hard to imagine a world in which social media is awash with doctored videos targeting ordinary people to exact revenge, extort or to simply troll.

In that scenario, where Twitter and Facebook are algorithmically flooded with hoaxes, no one could fully believe what they see.

The consequences could be devastating for the notion of evidentiary video, long considered the paradigm of proof given the sophistication required to manipulate it.

"I've been working in this space for tw decades and have known about the issue of manipulated video, but it's never risen to the level where everyone panics," Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College who often consults for law enforcement, said. "But this machine-learning-generated video has come out of nowhere and has taken a lot of us by surprise.

The chance of stopping technology like computer-generated video form advancing is highly unlikely, experts say. That means the onus is on those who watch the news and those who report it to verify video the best they can.
