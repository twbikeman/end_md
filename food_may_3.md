# Cajun Bayou Food Trail Tour #

One Louisiana partish is doing its part to keep alive for visitros the special appel of Cajun cuisine and the unique culture that surrounds it.

Located about an hour's drive south of New Orleans, Lafourche Parish is a 1,500-square-mile swath of saltwater marshes, bayous and crossroads communiites. It is a region authentically and unapologetically Cajun to its roots, going all the way back to its 17th-centurey settlement as a district of New France.

Seeking a plan designed to pormote its wealth of Cajun eateries, the parish tourist ofice--Louisiana's Cajun Bayou Tourism--launceded the Cajun Bayou Food Trail. The Trail is comprised of 18 restaurants and six festivals and events, all of which focus on helping visitors understand how the region's food and culture are so deliciously and forever intertwined.

"Here along the Bayou, Cajuns use what's around them, pulling from the water and plucking from the land to find the freshest ingredients--and then they tend to mix it all together in one big pot," says Timothy BUsh, president and CEO of Louisiana's Cajun Bayou Tourism. "Our food has  a story that's rooted in traditions and expressed by the wonderful storytellers who own and operate restaurants along the Trail."

## Almost time to hit the trail! ##

I was pleased to accept an invitation from Bush and staff members Melissa Durocher and Kellie Walters to take a spin along the Trail shortly after its inauguration last May.

This wouldn't be my first visit to Cajun Country. My appetite was nonetheless primed for this return visit, with taste buds tingling in anticipoation of such down-home delights as gumbo, etouffee, jambalaya, boiled crab and crawfish, red beans and rice, po'boys and pecan pralines.

Most of the 18 restaurants on the Cajun Bayou Food Trail are strung out along Louisiana Highway 1.
