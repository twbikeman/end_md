# How to better communicate in emails #

Hi, readers!

Let's talk about email!

What's with all the exlamation points? I'm serious. Have you notice how this one punctuation mark dominates your email messages--both those you get and those you send?

To be taken seriously at work, you have to pay attention to how you communicate via email. Too many exclamations and you look silly. But you dont' want to fire off curt missives either.

I believe that there are three reasons for all these exclamation marks, and none is good for your business, career or conveying your message.


1. Laziness

I try to read over my emails before sending them, weeding out exclamation points and making sure the message is clear. Here's why: I'm writer and a professional communicator, and exlamation points are lazy. It takes longer to think of something original or specific to say.

2. Guilt

Sometimes we try to make email recipients feel better or assuage our own guilt for asking too much--all with the stroke of an exclamation point. We don't know how to have difficult or even straightforward dialog electronically.

Who hasn't gotten an email like this from a higher-up?

"I know it's late notice, but I need that report today, not tomorrow, OK? I'll be online tonight, so just get it to me ASAP!"

No, If you are asking or telling someone to go above and beyond for you, be upfront about that. You need to acknowledge that what you're requesting is a big deal and ask if it is feasible and how you can help. Question marks and periods are your go-to punctuation marks here.

3. Peer pressure

Just because you get an email laden with exclamation marks, or your boss always uses them, it doesn't mean you need to, too. Once you start relying on exclamation marks, you can't really stop without fear that people will take you as being terse. Who has time for that? The key is to be mindful and intentional.
